The Mobile Application Development Life Cycle (MADLC) is a systematic approach introduced by \textcite{vithani14} to address various issues presented by mobile applications. These apps frequently include complex functionality that differs greatly from conventional desktop applications. The introduction of MADLC aimed to establish a structured framework for the development of mobile apps, recognizing the necessity for a customized approach \parencite{vithani14}. \\

\textcite{kaur15} addressed the significance of a dedicated development strategy for mobile applications, acknowledging their unique characteristics. \textcite{kaur15} also emphasize the necessity of adopting a unique methodology to address the unique characteristics and needs of mobile app development. MADLC addresses this requirement by providing a systematic and sequential approach that corresponds to the distinct difficulties and characteristics of mobile app development, including diverse screen sizes, device functionalities, and user expectations. \\

The Mobile Application Development Life Cycle (MADLC) consists of multiple stages that provide a structured framework for the development of mobile apps, as outlined by \textcite{wambua23} and explained by \textcite{wen21}. The following stages are crucial for developing mobile applications that achieve success:

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
    \item \textit{Identification:} The identification step involves identifying the problem statement and establishing the goal and objectives for creating the mobile application. System requirements are collected and the target audience is determined. Market research is performed to evaluate the potential viability of the application, and specific project scope and objectives are established.
    \item \textit{Design:} After the identification phase, the design phase begins. Developers are responsible for developing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) elements of the application. During this phase, flowcharts, Use Case Diagrams (UCD), Hierarchical Models, and Sequence Diagrams are generated. Wireframes, mockups, and prototypes are created to visually represent the structure and user experience. The selection of the suitable technology stack, databases, and architecture for the mobile application has been made.
    \item \textit{Development:} During the development phase, developers begin coding the mobile application, building its functionality according to the previously gathered design and specifications. This phase involves incorporating functionalities and ensuring consistency with the design and user experience principles. If necessary, backend systems, APIs, and server components are developed.
    \item \textit{Prototyping:} During this stage, the process of combining different systems and coding the front end and back end happens. Developers create a high-fidelity prototype of the mobile application, which includes important features and functions. The prototype plays a vital role in the development process by enabling the examination and verification of concepts and features. Early user feedback is sought and utilized to identify and address any design or functionality concerns before moving forward.
    \item \textit{Testing:} Quality assurance and testing are essential elements of MADLC. During this phase, a range of testing methods are employed, including functional testing, usability testing, performance testing, security testing, and compatibility testing across many devices and platforms. Testers detect and document defects and problems, which the developer then resolves to guarantee that the mobile application fulfills its functional specifications and provides a smooth user interface.
\end{enumerate}

These phases offer a systematic approach to the creation of mobile applications, guaranteeing that the outcome is in line with objectives, displays a strong design, undergoes comprehensive testing, and fulfills the requirements of its intended users. Nevertheless, it is critical to acknowledge that the MADLC has seven essential stages: identification, design, development, prototyping, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Within the scope of this project, the primary focus is on the early stages of the MADLC, specifically covering the identification to testing phases.
