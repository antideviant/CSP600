\chapter{RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS}
\label{ch:results}

\section{Introduction}
This chapter defines and explores the deliverables and objectives following their particular goals. This chapter extensively examines various aspects of the Alunan mobile application development process, including detailed descriptions of system requirements, user personas, storyboard creation, flowcharts, use case diagrams, database configurations, and the evolution of designs from low-fidelity to high-fidelity.

\section{Identification of System Requirements}
The process of identifying system requirements is comprehensive, requiring the collection, analysis, and documentation of the constraints and demands of a system or application \parencite{mokos20}. Generally, this process starts with stakeholder engagement to gain insight into the business objectives. Subsequently, requirements are obtained through workshops, surveys, and interviews. The examination of these requirements entails the recognition of connections, priorities, and possible conflicts; documentation serves to guarantee clear communication and consistency among the parties involved. Furthermore, the incorporation of validation and verification mechanisms serves to guarantee that the specified requirements precisely mirror the intended functionalities and limitations of the system. \\

The creation of system requirements is critical to the achievement of project objectives, as they provide the fundamental structure that guides the entirety of the development process. They offer designers, developers, and testers a strategic plan that directs their efforts toward developing a solution that satisfies the requirements of stakeholders. Incomplete or ambiguous requirements may necessitate expensive iterations of validation testing and design modifications in later stages. The unresolved difficulty of validating and refining system requirements early on emphasizes the significance of system requirements throughout the development process. \textcite{mokos20} stated that efficient and precisely defined requirements minimize the likelihood of costly rework or project failure, and promote clear communication among project teams. In simple terms, comprehensive system requirements increase the probability of successfully implementing a solution that fulfills the demands of stakeholders, accomplishes organizational goals, and provides value.

\subsection{System Requirements}
System requirements, as elucidated by \textcite{mokos20}, delineate the essential conditions and functionalities that a system must possess to meet the objectives and expectations of stakeholders. They function as a strategic plan that directs the development process by defining the intended functionalities, standards for performance, and limitations. Although frequently expressed in informal terms, system requirements may contain uncertainties, which calls for their formalization to achieve clarity and accuracy. \\

Addressing the development of the Alunan mobile application, this section provides a comprehensive overview of the system's requirements. Based on user expectations, system requirements are the capabilities that the system might be required to have The generation of potential solutions to a problem begins with the creative processes of ideation and brainstorming. By employing judgment and deduction, an extensive inventory of suggestions can be generated, a portion of which might even surpass the original ideas in terms of originality or unconventionality.

\begin{enumerate}[A.]
    \item \textbf{Functional Requirements and Non-Functional Requirements} \\ Functional requirements are the features or functions that developers must implement for users to complete their tasks. Meanwhile, non-functional requirements specify the attributes, characteristics, and constraints that govern the overall behavior, usability, and performance of a system, beyond its functional capabilities. These tasks should correspond to the problem statement presented in Chapter 1. Tables 4.1 and 4.2 show the functional and non-functional requirements for the Alunan mobile application. \\

\section{Designing Alunan: A Mobile Application for Local Musicians’ Online Community and Music Discovery}
This section explores the crucial structure plan required to ensure a consistent and efficient mobile application. This section also addresses Objective 2 from Chapter 1, which involves to design Alunan as a mobile application for local independent musicians’ online community and music discovery. This section includes user personas, a SCAMPER technique table, a storyboard, a flowchart, a Use Case Diagram, a Hierarchical Model, a low-fidelity prototype, and a medium-fidelity prototype. The study design and diagrams will offer a thorough overview and explanation of the project's development design.

\subsection{User Persona}
Recognizing users is the basis on which user-centered applications are built. User personas are organized depictions of the intended audience. These personas are not merely fictional characters; they are tangible archetypes that provide direction for app development in the actual world. The user persona documentation presents a range of individuals, each with unique backgrounds, objectives, and experiences. By examining their features, behaviors, and pain areas, we can determine the most effective way for the app to fulfill their demands. Figures 4.1 and 4.2 display the user personas for each user of Alunan. \\

\subsection{SCAMPER Technique}
\textit{Purpose:} SCAMPER is a technique for looking at possible transformations that you could apply to a product or process. \parencite{santos15} Looking at these transformations can help you identify "out-of-the-box" approaches by looking at the problem from different perspectives. It is particularly useful where conventional approaches to the problem may already have been tried unsuccessfully. SCAMPER stands for: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify/Magnify/Minify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, Rearrange/Reverse.

\hline
M & Modify & What ways can we completely change the product/process? Can it be improved by making it stronger, larger, higher, longer, exaggerated or more frequent? Can it be improved by making it smaller, lighter, shorter, less prominent or less frequent? & Modify the review character limit to allow for longer, more detailed reviews, enabling enthusiasts to provide more comprehensive feedback to musicians. \\
\hline
P & Put to other uses & What other products/processes could do what we need to do? What other things are going on that we could make use of it? & Put the music ratings and reviews to other uses by aggregating data to provide insights and analytics for musicians, helping them understand audience preferences and improve their music. \\
\hline
E & Eliminate & What would happen if we remove a component of the product/process? What would happen if we remove the whole thing? How could we achieve the same objective if we weren't able to do this way? & Eliminate redundant features or options in the user interface to streamline the user experience and reduce clutter. \\
\hline
R & Rearrange & What if we reversed the process? What if we did step B before step A? What if we moved step A \& did it last step of step Z first? What if we did these two steps together? & Rearrange the layout of the 'My Reviews' page to prioritize recently reviewed posts, allowing enthusiasts to easily keep track of their recent interactions with musicians. \\

\subsection{Data Design for Alunan: A Mobile Application for Local Musicians’ Online Community and Music Discovery}
\begin{enumerate}[A.]
    \item \textbf{Hierarchical Model Diagram}

        \caption{Hierarchical Model Diagram for Alunan Mobile Application}
        \label{fig:myfig46}
    \end{figure} \\
    The hierarchical diagram for the Alunan mobile application is depicted in Figure 4.7 below. It represents the overall structure of the database and provides a clear image of how data is organized in it. At the first level, key entities such as User, Post, Review, and Favourite are identified, each carrying unique forms of data. User, for example, submit information such as their role, name, email, password, Spotify profile, and photo. Furthermore, Post represent critical information such as post description, and date posted. Meanwhile, Review symbolizes the rating and review that the enthusiast submits. Lastly, Favourite represents data such as mid\_user, and id\_user, that store any musician profile that is bookmarked by the enthusiast. The second level looks into the fundamental characteristics of each object, providing a more detailed view which are id\_user, id\_post, id\_review, and id\_favourite.

    \item \textbf{Entity Relationship Diagram}

        \label{fig:myfig47}
    \end{figure} \\
    The ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) presented in Figure 4.8 shows the structure of the Alunan mobile application database, emphasizing significant entities and the relationships between them. The entities consist of USER, POST, REVIEW, and FAVOURITE. The relationships involve USERS generating POSTS and adding REVIEWS. Table 4.6 contains a data dictionary that provides a detailed description of the attributes of each table. The data dictionary specifies the contents, data types, formats, and if the attributes are necessary. It also indicates whether the attributes are primary keys (PK) or foreign keys (FK). The table captions in Table 4.7 provide a concise description of the data types utilized. This complete structure guarantees a clear and structured database architecture for effective data management within the application.
