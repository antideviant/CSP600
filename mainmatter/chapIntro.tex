\section{Problem Background}
change to something related to symptoms, perceived problems and problem domain from o-i-see.
In today's digital age, where the online world has changed how we interact with music, Alunan aims to bring together two key groups - local musicians who are at the core of the music scene and music enthusiasts who bring it to life. This application proposes an effective connection between these two worlds, allowing people a dedicated area to interact, discover, and immerse themselves in their local music culture. \\

As underlined by \textcite{ong19}, the evolution of the music scene in Malaysia reflects the cultural and social dynamics of musical expression among specific audiences and musicians. The influence of alternative media, blogs, and websites in forming this music community is indisputable. Alunan acknowledges the need to protect and preserve this rich tradition while embracing innovation, functioning as a platform that honors the past while advancing the future. \\

Furthermore, the post authored by \textcite{mohd21} underlines the necessity of keeping the tradition of Malaysian music while accepting new ideas and developments. The Malaysian music environment, with its many influences, serves as the backdrop against which Alunan operates. By offering a platform where traditional music can coexist seamlessly with new influences, Alunan enables musicians to express themselves genuinely, ultimately contributing to the preservation and advancement of the Malaysian musical identity. \\

In addressing the difficulty of helping emerging artists stand out in a period of oversaturation of music online, as highlighted by \textcite{haynes18}, Alunan emphasizes the crucial importance of social media in the careers of independent musicians. It attempts to empower these artists to navigate online platforms efficiently, recognizing both the benefits and limitations of social networking for musicians. \\

In essence, Alunan marks an innovative and establishing effort within the realm of Malaysian music. It encourages the development of local musicians and promotes an authentic feeling of community among enthusiasts of music. The project's commitment to conserving musical traditions, absorbing creative ideas, and employing digital tools establish it as an instrument for the continuous evolution and revolution of the local music industry.

\section{Problem Statement}

\end{figure}
The primary topic for the problem statement is closely aligned with the findings of \textcite{silahudin19}, who discussed the significance of the music scene's evolution in Malaysia, as well as the cultural and social dynamics of musical expression among specific audiences and musicians. Similar to the challenges faced by folk music in the music industry awards, the present problem relates to the lack of a specialized digital community platform tailored to Malaysian musicians. The issue at hand exhibits several clear indications, such as the fragmented digital presence of local musicians, their insufficient exposure in the world of online media, and the obvious lack of efficient collaboration and promotion tools. \\

The spread of local musicians across multiple websites and applications is one of the principal symptoms. The lack of consistency in their online presence hinders their capacity to establish a strong identity, thereby creating difficulties for supporters and potential collaborators in locating and interacting with them. Moreover, current platforms frequently lack musician-specific functionalities and struggle with intense competition for attention. As a result, a considerable number of highly talented musicians in the area experience a sense of detachment from the music industry and appreciation, which hinders their ability to build significant relationships with their peers and audience. \\

\end{figure}
The user @zharifikml's concerns expressed on X align with the findings discussed by \textcite{zanuar22} regarding the effectiveness of social media platforms in marketing for independent artists, emphasizing the need for local musicians to acquire the skills required to showcase their creations on the internet. The absence of a dedicated platform for musicians may result in cultural loss, as the multifaceted Malaysian music landscape might remain unexplored and uncelebrated. Furthermore, the challenges in social media marketing mentioned in the article parallel the user's concerns about the need for musicians to acquire internet exposure skills. The depreciation of local musical expertise, as mentioned by the user, can adversely affect the financial stability of musicians, echoing the challenges faced by independent artists in using various social media platforms to engage with different segments of their audience. Additionally, the absence of a suitable platform for growth and visibility, as emphasized by the user, aligns with the evolving role of social media in music promotion discussed in the article by \textcite{jarvekulg21}, highlighting the importance of addressing the challenges musicians face in the digital age and the need for a dedicated platform to support their growth and visibility. \\

To summarise, the present issue pertains to the lack of a dedicated digital community platform catering to Malaysian musicians. It is important to acknowledge and resolve the symptoms and perceived issues associated with this problem domain to facilitate the empowerment of local musicians, promote connections between them and their supporters and colleagues, and actively contribute to the conservation and advancement of Malaysia's vast musical heritage.
