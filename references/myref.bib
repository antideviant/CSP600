  abstract = {Given the growing commercial importance of the “user experience”, better application of gamification. Thus, this study aims at exploring the antecedents and consequences of user experience and its mediating role in an online gamification context. Specifically, this study uses structural equation modeling to test the causal relationships among perceived mobility, utilitarian and hedonic features, user experience, perceived benefits (self-benefit and social benefit), types of perceived value (information value, experiential value, social value, and transaction value), and brand equity (perceived quality, brand loyalty, brand associations, and brand trust) in an online gamification context. Results show that perceived mobility has a significant impact on utilitarian and hedonic features, while perceived mobility and utilitarian and hedonic features influence user experience, which in turn, affects perceived benefits, types of perceived value, and brand equity. Additionally, the mediating effect of user experience is also confirmed in this study. In summary, the findings of this study can help website managers improve their users' perception of benefits, value, and brand equity more effectively and act as a guide to research and development (R&D) of gamification to obtain competitive advantage in the online context.},

  journal  = {Array},
  volume   = {7},
  pages    = {100030},
  abstract = {System requirements define conditions and capabilities to be met by a system under design. They are a partial definition in natural language, with inevitable ambiguities. Formalisation concerns with the transformation of requirements into a specification with unique interpretation, for resolving ambiguities, underspecified references and for assessing whether requirements are consistent, correct (i.e. valid for an acceptable solution) and attainable. Formalisation and validation of system requirements provides early evidence of adequate specification, for reducing the validation tests and high-cost corrective measures in the later system development phases. This article has the following contributions. First, we characterise the specification problem based on an ontology for some domain. Thus, requirements represent a particular system among many possible ones, and their specification takes the form of mapping their concepts to a semantic model of the system. Second, we analyse the state-of-the-art of pattern-based specification languages, which are used to avoid ambiguity. We then discuss the semantic analyses (missing requirements, inconsistencies etc.) supported in such a framework. Third, we survey related research on the derivation of formal properties from requirements, i.e. verifiable specifications that constrain the system’s structure and behaviour. Possible flaws in requirements may render the derived properties unsatisfiable or not realizable. Finally, this article discusses the important challenges for the current requirements analysis tools, towards being adopted in industrial-scale projects.},
